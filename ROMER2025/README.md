3D Cameras Project

This repository contains Python scripts for working with RealSense cameras and processing the captured data to create 3D point cloud models.
Files

    realsense_r200.py: This script is a basic camera tester. It iterates through a range of video devices (/dev/video4 to /dev/video9) and displays the video feed. It allows you to:

        Press 'q' to quit the current camera and move to the next.

        Press 's' to save a single frame as an image in the saved_images directory.

        Press 'r' to start or stop video recording, saving the output to the saved_videos directory.

    realsense_3d.py: This script captures synchronized RGB and depth frames from a RealSense camera. It visualizes the combined frames and allows you to save the paired images.

        Press 's' to save the current RGB and depth frames to rgb/ and depth/ directories, respectively.

        Press 'q' to quit the script.

    3d_model.py: This script takes a single pair of RGB and depth images and generates a 3D point cloud model using the Open3D library. It visualizes the generated point cloud and saves it as an output.ply file.

    merge_frames.py: This script is designed to process multiple pairs of RGB and depth images (saved from realsense_3d.py) and merge them into a single, comprehensive point cloud model. It iterates through a predefined list of frame pairs, creates a point cloud from each, and combines them into one final model. The script then visualizes this merged model and saves it as merged_model.ply.

    README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

    merged_model.ply: This is a sample output file, a 3D point cloud model in PLY format, generated by the merge_frames.py script. It contains vertex data with x, y, z coordinates and red, green, blue color values.

Usage
1. Capture Data

First, you need to capture the RGB and depth data using the realsense_3d.py script. This will create rgb/ and depth/ folders with your saved frames.

python realsense_3d.py

Press 's' to save frames as you move the camera around the object you wish to scan.
2. Create a Single 3D Model

To create a 3D model from a single pair of saved frames, use the 3d_model.py script, providing the paths to the RGB and depth images.

python 3d_model.py rgb/frame_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png depth/frame_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png

3. Merge Multiple Frames

To create a more complete 3D model by merging multiple frames, you can use the merge_frames.py script. Before running, you need to edit the frames list within the script to include the filenames of the RGB and depth image pairs you want to merge.

# In merge_frames.py, update this list with your file names:
frames = [
    ("rgb/frame_20231027_153001.png", "depth/frame_20231027_153001.png"),
    ("rgb/frame_20231027_153002.png", "depth/frame_20231027_153002.png"),
    # Add all your frame pairs here
]

After updating the list, run the script:

python merge_frames.py

This will create a merged_model.ply file.
Requirements

The scripts require the following Python libraries:

    pyrealsense2

    open3d

    numpy

    opencv-python (cv2)

You can install them using pip:

pip install pyrealsense2 open3d numpy opencv-python
